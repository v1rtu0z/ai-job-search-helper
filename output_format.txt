### Overall Fit
Provides a concise summary of how well the user's profile fits the job description. Start it by giving a very visible "score" which should be one of: very poor fit, poor fit, moderate fit, good fit, very good fit, questionable fit. The questionable fit should be used only when there isn't enough information. Note that missing core skills for a job shouldn't be able to lead to more than a poor fit. Similar logic should apply for details like salary, location, industry etc, if the user has specified them of course. For the score - insert an HTML block like this: <span style="color:red">*red* fit score</span>. and color the score from red to green so that it's very obvious to the user.

### Strengths
Lists the key skills, experiences, and qualifications from the context that match the job posting.

### Areas for Improvement
Identifies any potential gaps or areas where the user's profile does not align with the job description. Mention specific skills, keywords, or experience levels.

### Actionable Advice
Provides clear, actionable advice on how the user could tailor their resume or cover letter to better highlight their fit for this specific job.

If the provided "Job Description" text is not a job description, return a simple markdown message that says: "### Not a Job Description Found
